# NLP
Sanskrit and Marathi translator using NLP Models -  
These models translate the under-resourced Languages like sanskrit and marathi to English. This model consists of a sequence-to-sequence model using LSTM. The seq2seq models are usually the best choice for solving complex problems in NLP. To use the seq2seq model, an encoder-decoder architecture is needed to be built. The encoder reads the input sequence and summarizes it into a hidden layer of LSTM. The decoder is able to receive this data and generates a sequence based on it.
